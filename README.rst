``django-settings-diff``
========================

A very simple tool to help diff two Django settings modules.

Motivation
----------

Let's say that you have done some significant refactoring to your settings module. For example, you have gone from a single settings file to a modular approach, where there is no longer a single ``settings.py``. You want to make sure that your settings are effectively *exactly* the same as before, though! Of course you can't rely on simple file diffing, since there is no longer a single ``settings.py``.

There are some non-intuitive things to account for, which ``django-settings-diff`` handles for you:

1. Even with a single ``settings.py``, there is a (potentially) significant difference between simply importing the file and the "final" settings that are used by Django (see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/settings/#using-settings-in-python-code). That is, we want to compare the *actual settings at runtime*!
2. The ``settings`` object cannot be naively treated as a ``dict`` -- it is similar, but different enough to prevent easy diffing (the native settings object thwarts both ``pprint`` and ``deepdiff``).

So, it isn't doing anything crazy, but it removes some overhead.

Installation
------------

Install from pip (recommended):

::
    $ pip install django-settings-diff

Or, install straight from the repo:

::
    $ git clone https://github.com/GreenBankObservatory/django-settings-diff
    $ pip install django-settings-diff

Note that this will install a wrapper script for you: ``diffsettings``

Entry Points
------------

Use the wrapper script (recommended):

::
    $ diffsettings -h

Call the module:

::
    $ python -m django_settings_diff -h

Import as library:

::
    $ python
    >>> from django_settings_diff import diffsettings
    >>> help(diffsettings)

Usage
-----

There are two standard usage patterns.

You should first ensure that you have saved two versions of your settings. For this example we will use ``myapp/settings_old.py`` and ``myapp/settings_new.py``.

Alternatively, you could use the same ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` for both dumps, but swap the settings file itself in between. This is useful in repositories that rely on the settings file being a specific name, for example.

#1: Compare Python objects directly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This uses ``deepdiff`` internally to perform the diff.

Dump Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pickle the settings modules to disk:

::
    $ DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=myapp.settings_old diffsettings --dump old_settings.pkl
    $ DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=myapp.settings_new diffsettings --dump new_settings.pkl

Diff Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we can diff the two settings objects:

::
    $ diffsettings old_settings.pkl new_settings.pkl 

See the documentation for `deepdiff <https://github.com/seperman/deepdiff>`_ for help deciphering the output.

#2: Compare via external diff tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this method the settings are dumped as text files and then compared using a standard diff tool.

Dump Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dump the settings modules to disk (internally this uses ``pprint`` to print the settings object):

::
    $ DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=myapp.settings_old diffsettings --dump old_settings.txt
    $ DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=myapp.settings_new diffsettings --dump new_settings.txt

Diff Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Then, use your favorite diff tool to compare these. This should work quite well, since the object hierarchy has been broken up line by line.

For example:

::
    $ tkdiff {old,new}_settings.txt
